/*
This program helps us evaluate whether it would be more worth it for the user to 
1. Pay the minimum monthly payment and invest at the same time
2. Or pay off the loan first, and then invest

1. Ask the user for input on information such as their current loan amount, expected annual return of investment, current age, etc.
2. Turn the input into more usable forms (total months from now to retirement)
3. Calculate the amount of money that would be in the retirement accounts from the two methods
4. Display the values to the user to let them decide what option is best
